L-\/\+B\+F\+G\+S-\/B, converted from Fortran to C with Matlab wrapper

This is a C version of the well-\/known \href{http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgsb.html}{\texttt{ L-\/\+B\+F\+G\+S-\/B code}}, version 3.\+0.

It was created with f2c, then hand-\/coded to remove dependences on the f2c library

There is a Matlab mex wrapper (mex files and .m files, with example). This was the main motivation for converting to C, since compiling C and Fortran from Matlab is a pain, especially since many standard users don\textquotesingle{}t have a Fortran compiler (especially for Windows).

This is an update of my previous wrapper that was on the \href{http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35104-lbfgsb--l-bfgs-b--mex-wrapper}{\texttt{ Mathworks file-\/exchange}} from 2012--2015. This code is completely re-\/done. I no longer post on the mathworks file-\/exchange since they have a restrictive license that, e.\+g., prevents one from using that code with a Matlab alternative such as \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/}{\texttt{ Octave}}. This current code has not been tested under Octave but there is no reason why it should not be able to work without major modification.

More info on the algorithm is available at the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-BFGS-B:_Optimization_subject_to_simple_bounds}{\texttt{ L-\/\+B\+F\+G\+S-\/B wikipedia page}}. References for the algorithm\+:

There are wrappers for L-\/\+B\+F\+G\+S-\/B in other languages (most link to one of the 2.\+x versions, but some, like this \href{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lbfgsb3/}{\texttt{ R package}}, link to the current version 3.\+0).\hypertarget{md__l-_b_f_g_s-_b-_c__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{md__l-_b_f_g_s-_b-_c__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
To use in C, go to the {\ttfamily src/} subdirectory and type {\ttfamily make}. This is unnecessary if you just want to use the Matlab wrapper. For an example of how to call the library from C, see the {\ttfamily driver1.\+c} file. The included Makefile includes a test of the installation using the problem defined in {\ttfamily driver1.\+c}.

To use in Matlab, you need to compile the mex files. You can either go to {\ttfamily Matlab/} and type {\ttfamily make} from a shell (assumes you are using {\ttfamily gcc}, and using linux/\+Mac or Windows+cygwin), or from Matlab, go to the {\ttfamily Matlab/} subdirectory and run {\ttfamily compile\+\_\+mex.\+m} which will install the mex using whatever compiler you set up during {\ttfamily mex -\/setup} (should work for all linux/\+Mac/\+Windows). The Matlab install file also runs some basic test to verify the installation.\hypertarget{md__l-_b_f_g_s-_b-_c__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{License}\label{md__l-_b_f_g_s-_b-_c__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}

The L-\/\+B\+F\+G\+S-\/B algorithm was written in the 1990s (mainly 1994, some revisions 1996) by Ciyou Zhu (in collaboration with R.\+H. Byrd, P. Lu-\/\+Chen and J. Nocedal)

L-\/\+B\+F\+G\+S-\/B Version 3.\+0 is an algorithmic update from 2011, with coding changes by J. L. Morales.
